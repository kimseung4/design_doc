# DESIGN Document (Template)

Write a design document where you explain your project. You should clearly explain the problem you're trying to solve. Be sure to describe the domain you're working with and the users you're trying to target. Remember that the point of your design document is that you can hand it off to any developer and theoretically they would be able to understand and build the program.


## Topic
*What is the subject at hand?*
*Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?*

## Problem
*The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 11.4 million married-couple households, or 21 percent of all married-couple households in America in 2011, had at least one spouse born in another country. The number of international couples in a globalized 21st century is constantly raising.
21 century is a very fast-paced time. Everyone is busy. It’s hard to spare time for anything “extra”. Foreign language learning is a clear “extra”. It takes enormous amount of dedication to spare time and energy for that activity. That’s why language learning apps are so popular comparing to traditional face to face learning environments - the provide users with flexibility to learn language at the most convenient time and pace. But there are unfortunately no apps that allow to learn a language with a partner. It is usually the user and the program. When the initial motivation and excitement wear off people stop using language learning apps, because there’s noone to hold them accountable.
The research shows that if a couple takes on a certain activity together they are more likely to be more persistent/successful, so we suggest adding a language component into people’s daily digital behaviour - like messaging.

## Target Audience
*Who is your target audience? Describe in detail*

### User Stories
**Outline 2-3 user stories. Describe how they find out, engage and come back to your site. Provide rationale.**

Structure your user stories as features, so you can actually build it to meet the users needs.

**Example**: As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Keep these questions in mind:
- Who are you building the feature for? What type of user?
- What are you building and what will it accomplish?
- What kind of engagement and value will the feature/website bring for the user? What does it accomplish?

- **User Story 1:**
- **User Story 2:**
- **User Story 3:**
- **User Story 4:**


## Strategy

This section should describe objectives, goals and metrics.

### Site Objectives:
*What do we want to get out of the site?*

### Success Metrics
*Outline how you will check that the goals for your site have been met*

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

* Pre assessments
* Formative assessments

## Scope
Functional and Content Specifications

## Structure
Interaction design and information architecture

## Skeleton
Interface, navigation, information design
(You'll provide wireframes here)

## Prototype and User Tests
Add any findings from your user tests

## Reflection
Reflect on and articulate specific issues you had with your midterm. Elaborate on these issues and explain how what you learned from the midterm has impacted your design thinking and execution on the final project.
